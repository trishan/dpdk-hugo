First version of a new feature must be submitted before the proposal deadline. Features that miss this first period will be deferred until the next release.\nUpdated versions of patches (v2, v3, etc.) will be submitted to address comments. The new features must be properly reviewed, tested and accepted before the integration deadline. Otherwise, they will be postponed to the next releases.\nAt the end of the merge window, the first release candidate is out.\nThe last period is 1 month long and is dedicated to bug fixing.\nScheduling 18.05  Proposal deadline: March 9, 2018 Integration deadline: April 6, 2018 Release: May 23, 2018  18.08  Proposal deadline: June 8, 2018 Integration deadline: June 29, 2018 Release: August 1, 2018  18.11 (LTS)  Proposal deadline: September 7, 2018 Integration deadline: October 5, 2018 Release: November 2, 2018  Stable Releases There is a documentation page describing the guidelines of the stable releases.\nStable point releases follow mainline releases.\nAfter each -rc tag and after the final version, relevant bug fixes get backported by the stable maintainers into the respective branches in \u0026ldquo;bursts\u0026rdquo;.\nDevelopers can provide stable-specific patches by sending them to stable@dpdk.org only (avoiding dev@dpdk.org).\nAfter all the relevant bugfixes have been backported, regression tests are ran, and if clear, the stable release is announced.\nTypically a new stable release version follows a mainline release by 1-2 weeks, depending on the test results.\n   Next version Date End of life Maintainer     16.11.7 June 8, 2018 November 2018 (LTS) Luca Boccassi   17.11.3 June 8, 2018 November 2019 (LTS) Yuanhan Liu   18.02.2 June 8, 2018 June 2018 Luca Boccassi   18.05.1 August 24, 2018 August 2018 Christian Ehrhardt   18.08.1 November 16, 2018 November 2018 Looking for volunteer   18.11.1 January 11, 2019 November 2020 (LTS) Kevin Traynor    "
