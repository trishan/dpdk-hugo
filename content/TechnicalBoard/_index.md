### Scope

The decision making process is primarily based on consensus. However in rare cases, the Technical Board can make a decision when consensus is not reached on the mailing list.

The scope of this body is limited to the questions directly related to the development in the following repositories:

* dpdk.git
* dpdk-stable.git
* dpdk-next-*.git
* dpdk-ci.git
* dpdk-web.git

### Members

The 9 current members of <techboard@dpdk.org> are

* Bruce Richardson
* Ferruh Yigit
* Hemant Agrawal
* Jerin Jacob
* Konstantin Ananyev
* Olivier Matz
* Stephen Hemminger
* Thomas Monjalon

### Renewal

Technical Board positions are held by individuals, not companies. However, employees of a single company should not occupy more than 40% of board seats.

It can be decided to remove a member if there is an approval of 2/3 of the whole Technical Board. It can be decided either to replace the member, or to redefine the size of the board.

There will be some renewal when it will be felt as needed.

### Meetings

A short meeting happens on IRC (freenode #dpdk-board) every two weeks.

The quorum required for a meeting to proceed is a 70% majority of the Technical Board.

The Chair is a rotating role among members.

Any contributor can ask to add a topic in the [agenda](https://annuel.framapad.org/p/r.0c3cc4d1e011214183872a98f6b5c7db) by sending an email to <techboard@dpdk.org>. The board members will add any topic of interest in the [agenda](https://annuel.framapad.org/p/r.0c3cc4d1e011214183872a98f6b5c7db).

Minutes are sent to <dev@dpdk.org> so anyone can comment. However, the technical discussions should happen in the original thread.

### Roles

- The new project repositories must be approved by the Technical Board, while applying the non-technical criteria defined by the Governing Board.
- If a patch does not receive any or enough comment, the board may discuss it in order to provide an input on the mailing list.
- If there is no consensus in a discussion, a decision can be taken by the Technical Board and explained on the mailing list.

For a vote to be passed, a majority (> 50%) of the total Technical Board is required (not just a majority of those in attendance at the meeting). In the event of a deadlock the Technical Board Chair shall have the casting vote.
